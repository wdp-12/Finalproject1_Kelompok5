<h3 align="center">Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic board game usually played by two players, each of whom uses the symbols "X" and "O." The goal of the game is to try to form horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines consisting of three of the same symbols (for example, three "X" or three "O") on a 3x3 game board. This game is usually played with simple strategy, but can become very competitive and challenging if both players have even skills.</h3>

## VS Computer/BOT

This menu allows players to play against the computer. Computers can be quite strong opponents with artificial intelligence programmed to make the best decisions every step of the way. This is a good choice if players want to practice or are just looking for a challenge in one player mode.

## Local Multiplayer

This menu allows two players to play against each other on the same device. This is a traditional multiplayer mode where two players take turns to place their symbols on the board. This mode is suitable for matches between friends, family, or anyone in close proximity.

## Playing History

This feature records the results of previous games, so players can view their game history. This includes information on Player1's Win Score, Draw Score, and Player2's win Score.
